## Introduction

This was my final week long project working as a small team to create our awesome budgeting app. We started with big goals to create an easy to use, assessible application that set itself apart from other budgeting applications out there. We also wanted to add mobile compatability, the ability to login and logout so that our clients could save their budgets and we could send monthly updates through to them (if they so desired).

You will see that we have chosen colours that comply with assessibility as well as labels for those with screen readers. We managed to write over 50 tests for this project both with jest, unit testing, and cypress for end-to-end tests. We used react-bootstrap to make the application mobile accessible for clients on the go. 

As a personal challenge, I was interested in learning more about authentication after our one day lesson during the bootcamp. I asked my team mates if I could have a go at creating the applications authentication myself from scratch. This was a huge challenge but one that I really enjoyed throughout the final week. As I developed and learnt at the same time it became clear that we would not have time to also create the save budget fucntionality we originally wanted. We repriortised making sure the graph was functioning correctly and application testing over showing a shonky save function. If you see a save function completed when you view this application I have been tinkering in my own time.
